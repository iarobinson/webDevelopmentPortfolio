    <p>My first location independent gig (meaning the first time I made money online) was producing a podcast for <a href="https://www.lewishowes.com" target="_blank">Lewis Howes</a>. Lewis introduced me to lots of his friends and before I knew it, I had produced hundreds of podcasts for a LOT of different people.</p>
    <p>While producing all those shows myself, I developed a very efficient process for banging out good consistent podcasts. In this course, I go step-by-step through that process to teach you how to do what I learned over the course of those years as a podcast producer.</p>
    <p>If you follow along with this video course, you will produce an actual podcast. We create recordings, engineer the recordings into .mp3 files, build a website which hosts the podcast and we then serve the podcasts to podcast networks.  Indeed, you will see your name on the iTunes charts.

      <h4>Dogukan Ozgen</h4>
      <p>100% best course on podcasting so far. Ian has a good teaching style. The content is detailed and well-structured. Specifically 'polishing' piece is a game changer. Also, the captions are very helpful. Not one second is wasted- all you need to know to start podcasting.</p>
      <h4>Carol Conkey</h4>
      <p>I thought that it was very good for beginners and for somewhat experienced podcasters. Most was review for me but and definitely picked up some great tips and tricks. Thanks.</p>
      <h4>Mike Bajrami</h4>
      <p>Really enjoyed Ian's course. Lots of good information to put into direct practice. I'm about to launch my new podcast with a co-host and I can't wait to share with you!</p>
      <h4>Joe O'Connell</h4>
      <p>Ian is a very fun, caring, encouraging instructor. He has a passion for his audience and getting them to take tiny steps to make progress towards their goals. The outline and pace of the course was great, and the content was very easy to understand and digest. By the end of the course you will absolutely know the key tricks to building a high quality podcast and get your content published.</p>
